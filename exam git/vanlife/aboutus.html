            <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
            <p>
                We are small starting company of young people who like travelling a lot and we want to share with you
                our experience of travelling through the vans. We want to give to our customers best memmories from
                journey and adventures from our vans.

            <h2>WE CARE...</h2>
            <p>
                Because we know that there exist a lot of environmental problems in the world, and we are people who are
                trying live eco-friendly we also made our vans a little bit eco-friendly to our environment. Most of our
                vans have built in the roof their own solar panel which is used as a source of energy for your van on
                journey.

            <h3> OUR TECHNOLOGY </h3>
            <p>
                Solar panels built in the roofs of our vans are used as a source of energy to vans. So you can use
                energy from that to cooking in your van or for lightning and heating. If you use energy from solar panel
                only for these things it will work for one week without charging it. But this energy from solar panel
                can be also used as motor energy instead of fuel for 200km. So if you are planning only short distance
                trip you can count on it that it wiill be eco-friendly!

            <h4>WHY TO CHOOSE US?</h4>
            <p>
                The main idea that we have is to provide you not only with a car, but also with a place to stay on your
                short weekend trips, or a longer term road trip around the continent. These vans are not only cars, but
                living, creating, relaxing spaces that you can design for yourself with the help of ours. You, finding
                our van as your home, is what we are seeking for!
